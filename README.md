This project involves creating a programmable attenuator using a PIC microcontroller with the STL034V1.0 board, or alternatively, 
a breadboard and individual components. Key components include the PIC microcontroller, RS232, MAX232, and the programmable attenuator. 
The software tools used are MikroC Pro for coding and Proteus Design Suite for virtual component connections. The process involves interfacing
the PIC microcontroller with the RS232 using MAX232, connecting the external programmable attenuator, and uploading the code to the microcontroller. 
The outputs are configured on Port B, but other ports can be used by modifying the code. Detailed information about the components, the code, and 
Proteus connections are provided in the attached file. The project aims to demonstrate the creation and testing of a programmable attenuator, allowing 
for various output combinations by adjusting Port B values.
